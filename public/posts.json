I made this website to practice concepts and to learn more about react and web development in general. I don’t expect this to have many views but either way, I want this blog to be like a note site.<br><br>I will upload a post (hopefully) every month where I will discuss new AI progress or some cool idea or thought that I might have about some issue. In the comments below (if someone even sees my posts, which I doubt will happen) you can comment about whatever you’d like, you can even insult me and be sure that I will not delete your comment, I want to hear what you think about what I discuss in my posts or the website or whatever really.<br><br>All right, that’s it for the first post. Godspeed.<br><br><em>- Jordi Cathew</em>"
